# TodoListApp


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Introduction 
This project demostrate GoogleKeep Todo App. You can Add an item to your list, edit it, drag it, and after you finished your task you can press on the check button and the task moves to the CheckedList.

## Structure 
I imported FireBase library and Created 2 tables "titles" and "checkedTitles".
Also used Dragula and ng2-editable for editing the the text.

In the script i made a service that comunicate with the Todo components and handle the tasks of Creating,Deleting ,draging and updating.

#style
I tried to make the UI as similar as the Google keep App.
